# Focus Session API

This API manages focus sessions, including creating, fetching, and handling streaks and completed sessions. The system uses **Node.js**, **Prisma** with **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis** for caching.

---

## Endpoints

### **Create Focus Session**

**POST** `/api/focus/create`

**Description:** Create a new focus session.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "completed": true,
  "paused": false,
  "duration": 25,
  "userId": "123"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Focus session created successfully"
}
```

---

### **Get Specific Focus Session**

**GET** `/api/focus/:userId`

**Description:** Fetch the latest focus session for a user.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "completed": true,
    "paused": false,
    "duration": 25,
    "userId": "123",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

---

### **Get Streak Count**

**GET** `/api/focus/streak/:userId`

**Description:** Fetch the current streak count for a user.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "streak": 5
}
```

---

### **Get Completed Sessions**

**GET** `/api/focus/completed/:userId`

**Description:** Fetch the total number of completed sessions for a user.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "completedSessions": 50
}
```

---

### **Get Daily Focus Sessions**

**GET** `/api/focus/daily/:userId`

**Description:** Fetch all focus sessions for the current day for a user.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "completed": true,
      "paused": false,
      "duration": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Error Handling

The API uses a centralized error handling mechanism. Errors are returned in the following format:

```json
{
  "status": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

---

## Caching Strategy

- **Redis** is used for caching frequently accessed data like:
  - Streak count
  - Completed sessions
  - Latest focus session
- Cache keys follow the pattern: `get{DataType}{userId}`
